// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Exercise 1:

get num1
get num2

print (num1 + num2)

Exercise 2:
if num1 / 2 == 0
print 'number is even'
else
print 'number is odd'


Exercise 3:
num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
avg_num = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 / 5
print 'the average is' avg_num
min_num = min(num1,num2, num3, num4, num5)
print "the min is' min_num
max_num = max(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)
print "the max is" max_num
